          Indeed, throughout their respective careers, Benjamin and Soraya have always pursued their sports and
          professional
          paths in parallel, creating a fundamental balance in their development. The workspace allows its residents to
          work
          on a daily basis in a unique environment while practicing a sport or discipline within the same place: Dojo
          House.

        significantly
        improve the overall work environment. Physical and psychological benefits such as better posture, focus, team

            With the rise of "caring management," companies now prioritize their employees' wellness. Our project aims to
            bring the world of sports to the corporate setting.
            <br />
            <br />
            Corporate sports programs not only improve serenity but also increase work effectiveness and productivity by
            reducing stress. This, in turn, leads to savings for the company and boosts profitability. Additionally,
            offering sports activities during work hours creates a positive corporate image. Companies that prioritize
            their employees' health are seen as caring, energetic, modern, innovative, and attractive to young talent.
            <br />
            <br />
            At our organization, we believe in the transformative power of integrating work and sport, creating a
            harmonious and thriving environment for both employees and businesses.
