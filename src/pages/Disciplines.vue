          Beyond being one of the most prestigious and universal Olympic disciplines, judo is more than a sport - it is
          also an acknowledged educational tool and a way of life enriched by a moral code and ethical values that have
          firmly withstood the trials of life.
          Respect, honesty, self-control, friendship, courtesy, honor, courage and modesty - the eight values of the judo
          moral code are taught to every judoka from the first time they enter a dojo. This code is entirely incompatible
          with procedures that would go against the spirit of the sport.

          <h1>What is Judo?</h1>
          <p class="font-barlow text-[20px]">
            Judo literally means "the gentle way." It is a sport developed from <u>JIU-JITSU</u>, a group of self-defence
            methods,
            but with certain harmful techniques eliminated or modified for safety's sake. Judo incorporates ethics, art
            and
            science into a sport that uses the opponent’s strength against themselves. Judo was developed in June 1882 in
            Tokyo, Japan, by Dr Jigoro Kano in a small hall that became the Kodokan, the mecca of judo. Kano defined the
            purpose of judo as the training of one's mind and body to use energy efficiently, in competition and everyday
            life, toward the goals of physical development, contest proficiency and mental and moral development.
            <br />
            <br />
            Judo is a combat sport in which the object is to <u>throw</u> (<b>Nage Waza</b>) your opponent properly but
            also help you to
            learn how to fall.
            <br />
            <br />

            The second part of Judo is <b>Ne Waza</b>, the object is to hold on the ground, or otherwise force an opponent
            to
            submit (using methods such as arm bars and chokes*) using the minimum required physical exertion.
            <br />
            *only for adults

          <h1>Why Practice Judo?</h1>
          <p class="font-barlow text-[20px]">
            Thanks to judo, you develop self-control, cooperative learning and respect for yourself and each other. Judo
            develops physical abilities such as flexibility, coordination, reflexes and balance as well as psychological
            abilities including focus, self-confidence and body awareness.
          </p>
          <br />
          <br />

          <h1>Who is it For?</h1>
          <p class="font-barlow text-[20px]">
            Judo is a sport for everyone, including children from as young as 4 years old. According to UNESCO, “Judo is
            the
            best initial training sport for children and young people”. It can be practiced at any age and any level.
